The balance of nature: Critical Role of Species Environmental Responses for Stability

This repository contains data, analysis, and supplementary materials for the manuscript titled "The Imbalance of nature: Critical Role of Species Environmental Responses for Stability".

Contents

Data: Contains the datasets needed to reproduce the analysis.

Figures_ms: Contains all the figures presented in the manuscript that are generated mainly in the .Rmd file called "Supplementary_info1".

Management: Information regarding project management and author contributions.

old: Contains deprecated or older code used in exploratory analysis.

r: Stores custom R functions used in the analysis.


Supplementary_info1.Rmd: provide a reproducible record of all analyses and figures in the main article.

Supplementary_info2.Rmd: Initial analysis of the response surface experiment. Contains the code used to select community compositions based on "divergence".

Supplementary_info3.Rmd: Analysis of the results of the Empirical Dynamic Modelling used to calculate species interactions.

Reports: folder containing the .html and .pdf files generated knitting the supplementary information .Rmd documents

Symmetry and Magnitude.Rmd: contains an exploratory analysis looking at how magnitude and and symmentry (two dimensions of imbalance) change with species richness and distribution of species responses.

Interactions_edm.Rmd: Code to preform the EDM analysis used to estimate species interactions coefficients.
